For most eCommerce brands, the integration consists of 3 main parts:

1. Installing the JavaScript snippet on your website
2. Integrating the Rimdian API to sync existing customer data
3. Configuring apps to integrate your digital marketing ecosystem (Google Ads, Facebook Ads...)

## For Shopify

The integration for Shopify is prettry straightforward.

We provide JavaScript snippets to extract products/orders/carts data from your Shopify template, and our official Shopify app will sync your customer data to Rimdian.

Webhooks will also be automatically activated to keep your Rimdian data up-to-date.

## For custom websites

It is recommended to create a private Rimdian app to sync your existing customer data to Rimdian. This way, you can extend the database schemas will custom columns & data types to fit your business needs.

<Tip>Creating a private app allows you to leverage the `scheduled tasks` & automatic retry mechanism in case of failure.</Tip>
