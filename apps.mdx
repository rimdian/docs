The whole platform has been designed around the concept of apps.

An app is an independent piece of software, that can be hosted anywhere & installed in your Rimdian workspace in order to extend the platform's capabilities. It can be a simple script that runs a periodic task, or a complex web application with specific data tables and logic.

## Apps capabilities

- **Embed their own UI** in the platform's Console
- **Filter & transform** incoming data
- **Listen to events** with webhooks
- **Add columns to existing tables** to store additional information
- **Create new tables** to store custom data
- **Register tasks** to be executed on a schedule
- **Access the platform's API** to read and write data
- **Execute SQL & analytics queries** on the platform's database


## Example of apps

- **Data import** - Import data from external sources, like your own databases, or third-party APIs.
- **Data enrichment** - Add additional information to your data, like geolocation, weather, or company information.
- **Data transformation** - Convert data from one format to another, or filter out irrelevant information.
- **Data forwarding** - Send data to external systems, like Google Ads Enhanced Conversions or Meta Conversion API...
- **Data visualization** - Create custom dashboards and reports.
- **AI & ML** - Train models and make predictions based on the whole dataset.
- **New features** - Add new features to the platform, like an affiliate marketing program, loyalty program...

## Types of apps

There are two types of apps:

- **Public apps** - Apps that are available to all Rimdian users. They are listed in the upcoming App Store and can be installed by anyone.
- **Private apps** - Apps that are only available to your organization. They are not listed in the App Store and can only be installed by uploading their [manifest.json](/apps-development/app-manifest-reference) file.
