## Specifications

Rimdian has been designed to be as much resilient and scalable as possible, and provides the following guarantees:

- **Data durability**: Thanks to the `Queue`, the data will be retried if a failure occurs.
- **Data consistency**: A database lock is acquired **at the user-level** for each data point (`session`, `pageview`, `order`...), ensuring that the data is not duplicated in case of concurrent processing.
- **Idempotency**: All data points can be processed multiple times, out-of-order, without any side effect.
- **Scalability**: The data `Collector`, `Queue`, `API Servers` & `Database nodes` can be scaled horizontally to handle more load.
- **Stability**: The `Queue` will automatically slow down the data ingestion if the `API Servers` are not able to keep up with the load.

## Data pipeline

There is **only one entry point** to the data pipeline: the `Collector`.

All data sources (your website, apps, API...) are sending data to the `Collector`, that pushes it to the `Queue`, that dispatches it to the `API Servers` for processing.

The `API Server` does the following **for every data point**:

<Steps>
<Step title="Persist the data">
The raw data is saved in the `Database` to avoid any loss.
</Step>
<Step title="Enrich or reject the data">
Apps who "subscribe" to the `before_validation` hook are called to enrich or reject the data (e.g: IP-to-location, IP filteringâ€¦).
</Step>
<Step title="Validate the data">
The payload is validated against the Rimdian tables schemas & apps schemas.
</Step>
<Step title="Acquire a lock">
A lock is acquired on the data at the user-level, to ensure consistency. If the lock cannot be acquired, the data will be retried few secs later.
</Step>
<Step title="Reconciliate the user identity">
The user identity is reconciliated to maintain a single view of the user.
</Step>
<Step title="Reattribute conversions">
Conversions are reattributed to the right marketing campaigns for `order` & `sessions` events.
</Step>
<Step title="Recompute user segments">
User segments are recomputed to keep them up-to-date.
</Step>
<Step title="Trigger workflows">
Marketing automation workflows who "subscribe" to the data point are triggered (e.g. sending an email when a new `order` is created).
</Step>
<Step title="Forward the data">
Apps who "subscribe" to the `on_success` hook are called for further processing (e.g. sending the data to a CRM).
</Step>
</Steps>

## Data consistency

Tracking web events is challenging. It's very common that web browsers send the same events multiple times, or out-of-order, or that the network is down.

Users also often close the browser before events are sent.

To handle these cases, Rimdian has been designed to be **idempotent** & **consistent**, which implies that the data points sent to the `Collector` should contain all the contextual information needed to heal the dataset.

In the following example of a web `pageview` hit sent to the `Collector` by the [JavaScript SDK](/javascript-sdk), the `user`, `device` and `session` objects are attached to the `pageview`, to make sure we can heal the dataset if they went missing.
