Only main features are listed here to give you an idea of what's coming next.

## Q2 2024

### File manager

A new file manager will be available in the Console to upload your files (images, documents, etc.) directly from the Console.

<Tip>These files will be served over a CDN and will be accessible from a subdomain of your website. Ie: `https://cdn.yourwebsite.com/image.jpg`</Tip>

The file manager is the first step towards bigger Email Marketing features, to host your images (logo, products...).

### Email marketing

You will be able to create and send newsletters directly from the Console.

This major update will bring:

- A new "Campaign" section in the Console to send "Broadcasts" (newsletters)
- "Subscription Lists" in the Users section to manage your subscribers
- A drag-and-drop email builder to create your newsletters
- A complete integration with the SparkPost email provider to collect and track your emails (opens, clicks, etc.)

### Workflows

Workflows will be the cornerstone of the platform, and will allow you to trigger complex automation rules based on the data you collect, in real-time.

For example, you will be able to create a workflow that sends an email to a user who triggered a specific event, like: "Send an email to the user 3 days after he placed an order".

## Q3 2024

### Custom dashboards

You will be able to create custom dashboards to visualize your data in real-time.

These dashboards will be fully customizable and will allow you to create your own widgets, with your own data.

### AI insights

The platform will start to provide AI insights to help you understand your data and make better decisions.

These insights will be based on the data you collect and will help you understand your users & marketing campaigns better.

## Q4 2024

### Public app store

A public app store will be available to install third-party apps directly from the Console.

These apps will be created by the community and will allow you to extend the platform with new features.
