### Aug 15 - App SQL Access

Apps can now register SQL access to be used by the app. This is useful for apps that need to connect to the database to import data without using the API.

It can also be used to connect an external BI tool directly to the database.

Example with the Google Ads app SQL access:

### Aug 2 - Relative time in user segments

User segments can now be matched by relative time periods. This allows you to create segments based on the user's activity in the last X days, weeks, months, or years.

A system task will automatically refresh the concerned user segments every 12 hours to keep them up to date.

### Jun 14 - Apps improvements

Apps can now be upgraded by providing a new version in the app manifest. This allows you to release new features, bug fixes, and improvements to your app.

The upgrade process takes care of saving the apps "custom tables" data before updating the database.

Apps can also declare their own [Cube schemas](/apps-development/cube-schemas) to provide custom computed metrics and dimensions to the platform.

### May 5 - WooCommerce app

A new WooCommerce app is available in the Console to connect your WooCommerce store to the platform.

### Apr 11 - Subscription lists

A new "Subscription Lists" section is available beside the user Segments in the Console. This section allows you to manage your subscribers and to create custom lists to send your newsletters.

### Mar 26 - Email editor

A new email editor is available to create email templates & your newsletters directly from the Console. This editor allows you to create beautiful emails with a simple drag-n-drop interface, and to preview them before sending.

The email links are automatically tracked (utm_source / medium / content) according to your template settings. And an "open pixel" is also automatically added to your emails to track the open rate.

The generated HTML code is backed by the [MJML framework](https://mjml.io/), and is fully compatible & responsive on all devices.

### Mar 19 - File manager

A new file manager is available in the Console to upload your files (images, documents, etc.) directly from the Console.
