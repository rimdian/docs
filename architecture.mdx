## Platform components

The platform is composed of:

- A data `Collector` - that receives all incoming data (sessions, pageviews, orders etcâ€¦) from various sources (website, apps...) and pushes it into the `Queue`.
- A `Queue` - that pushes data into the `API Server` for further processing. It acts as a buffer in case the `API Server` or the `Database` becomes unavailable to avoid loosing data.
- An `API Server` - that receives data from the `Queue` and requests from the `Console` & apps. It interacts with the `Database`.
- A SingleStoreDB `Database` - that stores the data.
- A `Cube Server` - that provides a semantic layer to compute analytics requests.
- A `Console` - for humans, accessible from your browser.
- `Apps` - that can be installed on the platform to extend its capabilities.

## Admins, organizations & workspaces

`Admins` are users who work for your organization & have access to the Rimdian `Console`.

`Users` are visitors & customers who visit your website to buy your products or services.

Admins can belong to many organizations, and each organization can have multiple workspaces.

The data is stored at the `workspace` level.
