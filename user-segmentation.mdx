Every user is unique, and the same marketing message won't resonate with everyone. User segmentation is the process of dividing your users into groups based on shared characteristics, such as demographics, behavior, or preferences. This allows you to tailor your marketing efforts to each group, increasing the likelihood of a positive response.

## Behavior

User segments are computed in real-time, for each incoming data point.

When segments are created or updated, a background task is triggered to recompute the segments for all existing users.

You can build segments based on any user attribute (country, gender...), activity (cart, order, custome event...) or computed metrics (average cart, orders count...).

An event is emmitted every time a user enters or leaves a segment, and Apps & workflows can subscribe to it to trigger actions, such as sending an email.

### SQL

Thanks to the distributed computing power of SingleStoreDB, the background task that recomputes the segments can process millions of users in few seconds.

Data scientists can check the SQL generated by the engine to understand how the segments are computed.
