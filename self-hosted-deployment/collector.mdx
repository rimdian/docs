The Collector is a **stateless** Docker image that can be deployed on any infrastructure that supports Docker.

You can scale it horizontally by deploying multiple instances of the collector.

It also acts as a 1st party tracking server, that rewrites the cookies server-side to prevent tracking blockers.

For that reason, if your website is hosted at `www.example.com`, you should deploy the collector on a sub-domain like `go.example.com`.

<Tip>An URL shortener will be added very soon to handle your digital marketing campaigns redirections (i.e: click from a newsletter...). So choose your sub-domain wisely.</Tip>


## Deployment

The Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rimdian/collector/tags) and can be pulled with the following command:

```bash
docker pull rimdian/collector:latest
```
