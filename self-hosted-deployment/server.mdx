The Server is a **stateless** Docker image that can be deployed on any infrastructure that supports Docker.

You can scale it horizontally by deploying multiple instances of the server. However it's important to activate an **auto-scaler** to handle the traffic spikes.

<Tip>If your Rimdian Servers can't keep up with the work, the Task Queue will slow down the processing rate and the buffer will grow.</Tip>

## Deployment

The Docker image is available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/rimdian/server/tags) and can be pulled with the following command:

```bash
docker pull rimdian/server:latest
```
