If you are a small company or a startup, you can use the free tier of SingleStoreDB and host it yourself on a single server.

If you are a larger company, you can use the cloud version of SingleStoreDB or host it on your own infrastructure.

Big virtual machines are very expensive in the cloud and don't deliver the same performance as a dedicated server. For that reason we recommend you to deploy SingleStoreDB on bare-metal servers while keeping the Collector & Rimdian Server in the cloud.

<Tip>A 24-core server (Intel Xeon Gold) with 128GB of RAM & 2x1TB NVMe SSDs costs around [$400/month with OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/en/bare-metal/scale/scale-i2/). Bandwidth is also free with OVH, which is not the case with cloud providers.</Tip>
