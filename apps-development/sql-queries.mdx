Apps can [register SQL queries](/app-manifest-reference#sql-query) to be used by the app. This is useful for apps that need to query the database for data.

Declaring the specific SQL queries in the app [manifest.json](/app-manifest-reference) allows the app to be more secure and performant. The app can also be more easily audited for security and performance.

## Example in app manifest

```json
...
  "sql_queries": [
    {
      "id": "appx_default_sql_query_1",
      "type": "select",
      "name": "SQL query 1",
      "description": "Example of predefined SQL query. For security reasons, use predefined queries to just fetch the data you needs",
      "query": "SELECT * FROM `user` WHERE external_id = ?",
      "test_args": ["auth-54-22"]
    },
    {
      "id": "appx_default_full_access",
      "type": "select",
      "name": "Full access",
      "description": "The app needs full 'read access' to the tables in order to do... (name the reason).",
      "query": "*"
    }
  ],
  ...
```

## Usage in the app

You can [execute an SQL query](/api-references/server/app-exec-query) by calling the `POST /api/app.execQuery` API endpoint with:

### Pre-defined SQL query

```json
{
    "workspace_id": "acme_workspace1",
    "app_id": "app_myapp1",
    "query_id": "app_myapp1_get_user",
    "args": ["user_123"]
}
```

### Custom SQL query

```json
{
    "workspace_id": "acme_workspace1",
    "app_id": "app_myapp1",
    "query": "SELECT u.* FROM `user` u INNER JOIN user_segment s ON u.id = s.user_id WHERE s.id = ? LIMIT 100",
    "args": ["segment_abc", "US"]
}
```

<Tip>Don't forget to escape the table names with backticks like: ```SELECT * FROM `user` LIMIT 1```. Especially for the `user`, `order` and `session` tables.</Tip>
