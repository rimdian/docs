Apps can [register tasks](/apps-development/app-manifest-reference#task) that will be executed by Rimdian at a specific interval or manually. This is useful for running background jobs, such as importing or exporting data to an external system.

A task can spin up to 10 workers running in **parallel**. The worker `0` is the main worker and the others are secondary workers. The main worker is the one that will be called when the task is launched.

Each worker has a JSON state, that can be used to store anything you need to keep track of the task progress.

When a task is launched, your app `webhook_endpoint` will be called with the following payload:

```json
{
    "api_endpoint": "https://RIMDIAN_API_ENDPOINT",
    "collector_endpoint": "https://RIMDIAN_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT",
    "workspace_id": "acme_workspace1",
    "app_id": "app_myapp",
    "app_state": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    },
    "kind": "task_exec_worker",
    "task_exec_worker": {
        "task_kind": "app_myapp_task1",
        "task_name": "My Task 1",
        "task_exec_id": "xxxxxxxx",
        "task_exec_created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
        "worker_id": 0,
        "worker_state": {
            "key1": "value1",
            "key2": "value2"
        },
        "retry_count": 0
    }
}
```

The response payload to the webhook allows you to:

- Mark the worker as done or not
- Return a message (optional)
- Return an error (optional)
- Update the current worker state (optional), useful to keep track of the worker progress (pagination...)
- Mutate the app state (optional)
- Return a list of data items to import to the Collector (optional)
- Delay the next job (optional), useful if you interact with external systems that have rate limits like the Amazon Seller API


**The webhook will timeout after 20 seconds.**

Example of a response for a job that is not yet done before 20 secs:

```json
{
    "is_done": false,
    "updated_worker_state": {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2"
    },
    "app_state_mutations": [
        {
            "operation": "set",
            "key": "key1",
            "value": "value1"
        },
        ... more mutations ...
    ],
    "items_to_import": [
        {
            "kind": "user",
            "user": {
                "external_id": "user1",
                "is_authenticated": false,
                "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "updated_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
                "email": "john@website.com"
            }
        },
        ... more items ...
    ],
    "worker_id": 0,
    "is_error": false,
    "message": "Task is still running",
    "delay_next_request_in_secs": 10
}
```
