Rimdian provides 2 types of APIs: 

1. **Data collector API** - This is the only entry point for importing data into Rimdian.
2. **Rimdian API** - This API is used to manage your workspace and settings.

## About the Data Collector

The sole job of the data collector is to receive data from external sources and push it into a queue for asynchronous processing.

There are 2 queues of data, per workspace:

1. **Live** - This queue is used to receive live data from the Javascript SDK or mobile apps.
2. **Historical** - This queue is used to import historical data from external sources.

<Tip>To make sure the platform reacts in real-time to users activity, it's very important to never import historical data into the Live queue.</Tip>

For testing purpose or very specific use cases, it is also possible to import data synchronously using the `POST /sync` endpoint. In this case, the queue will be skipped and the data will be immediately processed by a Rimdian Server.
