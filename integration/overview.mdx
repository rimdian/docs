As soon as you have a Rimdian workspace created, you can start integrating Rimdian into your digital marketing ecosystem.

For most eCommerce brands, the integration consists of 4 main parts:

1. [Configuring the workspace](/integration/workspace-configuration) to fit your business needs
2. Installing the [JavaScript SDK](/integration/javascript-sdk) on your website to collect the web activity
3. Integrating the [Rimdian API](/api-references/introduction) to sync existing customer data
4. Configuring apps to interconnect your digital marketing ecosystem (Google Ads, Facebook Ads...)

## For Shopify

The [Shopify integration](/apps/shopify) is prettry straightforward.

We provide JavaScript snippets to extract products/orders/carts data from your Shopify template, and our official Shopify app will sync your customer data to Rimdian.

Webhooks will also be automatically activated to keep your Rimdian data up-to-date when orders or customers are updated.

## For custom websites

It is recommended to create a private Rimdian app to sync your existing customer data to Rimdian. This way, you can extend the database schemas with custom columns & data types to fit your business needs.

<Tip>Creating a private app allows you to leverage the `scheduled tasks` & automatic retry mechanism in case of failure.</Tip>
