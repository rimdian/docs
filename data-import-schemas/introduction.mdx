Rimdian comes with predefined schemas for the most common types of content. These schemas are designed to handle most of the uses cases, but you can always extend them with Apps to store additional data.

Refer to the [Data Collector API](/api-references/introduction) section to import data into Rimdian.

## App items

Apps can define their own tables to store additional data. For example, a "Loyalty" app could define a `app_loyalty_points` table to store the points earned by users.

In such the data import item should look like:

```json
{
  "kind": "app_loyalty_points",
  "app_loyalty_points": {
    "external_id": "transaction_123",
    "created_at": "2021-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "user_id": "xxxxxxx",
    "points": 100
  }
}
```

## App extra columns

Apps can also define extra columns for the predefined schemas. For example, a "Loyalty" app could define a `app_loyalty_points` column for the `user` schema to store the points earned by users.

In such the data import item should look like:

```json
{
  "kind": "user",
  "user": {
    "external_id": "customer_123",
    "is_authenticated": true,
    "created_at": "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "created_at": "2024-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "app_loyalty_points": 100
  }
}
```
