Sessions are like buckets of user interactions (`pageviews`, `cart`, `order`…), and they have a source of trafic (i.e: Facebook, Google, physical store…) that is controlled by the `utm_source` + `utm_medium` fields.

Sessions are the building blocks of marketing multi-touch attribution.

When a user place an order on your website, Rimdian will gather all the sessions that contributed to this order to “attribute” them some credits for that conversion.

The `session` item also requires to provide the minimum required `user` object. This is mandatory to self-heal the dataset if the `session` is imported into the database before the `user` profile (out-of-order).

Installed apps might have added additional fields to your sessions. These fields are in the format: `app_appname_fieldname`

```jsx

{
  "kind": "session",
	// user with minimum required fields is mandatory:
	"user": {
    "external_id": "user_id",
    "created_at": "2022-10-30T22:21:48.020Z",
    "is_authenticated": true,
    "signed_up_at": "2022-10-30T22:21:48.020Z" // Required if is_authenticated = true
	},
	// then the session item:
  "session": {
    // REQUIRED fields
    "external_id": "session_id",
		"domain_id": "website", // see the configured Domains in your workspace
    "created_at": "2022-10-30T22:21:48.020Z",

    // optional fields
		"updated_at": "2022-10-30T22:21:48.020Z", // used to control the override of existing session fields
    "device_external_id": "xxx", // attach the session to a specific user device
		"timezone": "Europe/Paris", // defaults to workspace timezone if not provided
    "landing_page": "https://your-website.com/landing-page",
		"referrer": "https://referrer-website.com/page",

    "utm_source": "google.com",
    "utm_medium": "ads",
    "utm_campaign": "christmas",
    "utm_content": "banner1",
    "utm_term": "keyword1",
    "utm_id": "xxx",
    "utm_id_from": "gclid", // gclid / fbclid / rmd

		// APPs specific fields
		"app_appname_mystring": "abc",
		"app_appname_mynumber": 123.456
  }
}
```
