## Why?

With the end of 3rd party cookies, Google Ads can't track anymore the conversions that happen on your website. This means that you can't track the conversions that happen on your website and attribute them to the right ad click. This is a big problem for advertisers that rely on Google Ads to drive traffic to their website and track the conversions that happen on their website.

## Solution

The "Google Ads Enhanced Conversions" app allows you to forward the conversions that happen on your website to Google Ads in real-time.

## How?
