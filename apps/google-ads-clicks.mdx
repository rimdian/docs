## Why?

All the traffic sent by Google Ads to your website is tracked with a `gclid` URL parameter instead of the classic `utm` parameters (utm_source / medium / campaign / content / term).

With the absence of utm parameters, you won't be able to measure the performance of your Google Ads campaigns.

## Solution

When a user clicks on a Google Ads ad, the `gclid` parameter is added to the URL. This parameter is automatically collected by Rimdian and stored with each web session.

The app uses the Google Ads API to pull the campaign details for each of the `gclid` parameters collected, and updates the corresponding web session with the campaign details.

## How?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the app">
    Install the Google Ads Clicks app in your Rimdian workspace & connect your Google Ads account.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Google Ads sync">
    Periodically, the app will sync the `gclid` parameters with the Google Ads API to pull the campaign details for each of the `gclid` parameters collected.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Session update">
    When a gclid parameter is matched, the session utm_source, utm_medium, utm_campaign, utm_content, utm_term are updated with the Google Ads campaign details.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Clicks metadatas">
    All the clicks metadatas are also stored in a dedicated table (matching keywords, search queries, cpc...) for further analysis.
    </Step>
