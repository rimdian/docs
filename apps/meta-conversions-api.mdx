## Why?

With the end of 3rd party cookies, Meta (Facebook / Instagram) can't track anymore the conversions that happen on your website. This means that you can't track the conversions that happen on your website and attribute them to the right ad click. This is a big problem for advertisers that rely on Meta to drive traffic to their website and track the conversions that happen on their website.

## Solution

The "Meta Conversions API" app allows you to forward the conversions that happen on your website to Meta in real-time.

In addition to the conversions, the pageviews and the add to cart events are also forwarded to Meta. This allows Meta to optimize the ad delivery based on the events that happen on your website.
