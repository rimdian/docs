Integrating Rimdian with WooCommerce allows you to collect users navigation, import previous orders & customers and sync your data in real-time with webhooks.

The integration is composed of 2 steps:

1. Adding the [JavaScript SDK](/integration/javascript-sdk) on your template
2. Creating a WooCommerce API key and connecting it with Rimdian

## Adding the JavaScript SDK

<Tip>Make sure to read the [JavaScript SDK documentation](/integration/javascript-sdk) before moving forward.</Tip>

This integration requires the intervention of a frontend web developer.

## Creating a WooCommerce API key for Rimdian

In order to be able to import the previous orders & customers, and receive updates in real-time via webhooks, we need to connect Rimdian to your WooCommerce store API.

1. Go to `WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced > REST API`
2. Click on the button `Add key`
3. Select the `Read` permission
4. Then click on the button `Generate API key`
5. Grab the `Consumer key` and `Consumer secret`, and paste them into your Rimdian WooCommerce app.
6. Then connect your WooCommerce app in Rimdian
